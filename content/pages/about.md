Hello, I'm Mark.

I am a programmer, developer, engineer, technologist, or whatever we're now called. I like messing about with technology and making useful (and sometimes useless but interesting) things.

I worked for 20 years at Reedpop (formerly Gamer Network (formerly Eurogamer)) having been one of the first employees, and very much enjoyed being Technical Director for the latter half of my career there. I led both the technology and design groups and so, unsurprisingly, I had a broad remit. My most recent areas of technical focus were high performance content delivery archtectures and analytics. 

I parted ways with Reedpop recently and am currently enjoying a little time off to work on some novel things.
