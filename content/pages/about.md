Hello, I'm Mark.

I am a programmer, developer, engineer, technologist, or whatever we're now called. I like messing about with technology and making useful (and sometimes useless but interesting) things. I am easily distracted :-)

I currently lead the internal systems development team (a.k.a. "tools team") at [Collabora](https://www.collabora.com/), building software that automates business operations and insight. I haven't been there long, but it's good fun exploring a business, its people, processes, history and purpose.

Prior to this I worked for 20 years at Reedpop (formerly Gamer Network (formerly Eurogamer)) having been one of the first employees, and enjoyed being Technical Director for the latter half of my career there. I led both the technology and design groups and so, unsurprisingly, I had a broad remit.
